        <H1>...FRIEND...</H1>
        <H2>FIRST MEET</H2>
        <P>
            Our friendship started when she came in as a new admission to my hostel roomii. 
            Both of us were hesitant to talk to each other at first,
            I remember the first time she tried to talk to me and she asked for notes and then we 
            started our coversation. after sometimes we both get to know that our freqency matches.
            and her name is <strong>UTHPREKSHA</strong>.

            We spent our whole day together and sometimes we bunk the cls and go back to hostel
            and sleep....  we had so many memories with our whole group. we love travelling and cover 
            almost all places near our college.
